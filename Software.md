# Introduction #

This will serve as a general 'wish-list' of software items for this project.

# Details #

Initially I looked into using 'cuSDR' as a code base for this project.  However, after review of that code, I found that several required areas have not yet been developed, and became concerned (at the time) that it would take me (or others) too long to develop the required additions to it to support this project.

As of 2013-04-15 I began working with "Kiss Konsole" which I will be modifying a fair amount to add the requirements for this project.  This code is mainly written in C# and should be adequate to support the requirements.  This code is fairly simple and straight forward to work with, and I'm making better than expected progress with it as of this week.

As of 2013-04-01 I began working with the Altera Cyclone FPGA code in order to add in some requirements for this project to the SDR itself.  That work is progressing nicely as well, however may take a fair amount of 'ditzing-with'.

The Transmitted Chirp will be generated by Hermes FPGA code.  (at least that is what I'm attempting to do at this point).  This should ensure an 'on-time' GPS 1PPS timer chirp Transmission.  (which I hope to divide down to sub millisecond chirp times).

The idea when in Monostatic mode will be to simply tell Hermes that this mode is 'on', and to begin tx/rx cycles based on parameters set within the Kiss Konsole "CDAR" Settings.  (see screen shot of this SetupForm below).  This setup form allows us to:

  * Have a Master "CDAR" Enable/Disable
    * When enabled it adds three elements to the Form1 (MainForm):
      * SupplyVolts
      * "CDAR" start/stop button
      * "CDAR Mode" Dropdown list:
        * OFF
        * TX/RX (allows Hermes to run Monostatically (driven by timings withing the FPGA)
        * TX (Bistatic Transmission, and Testing Mode)
        * RX (Bistatic Reception and Testing)
    * When Disabled the Above Enabled options are hidden.
  * GPSDO Enabled
    * Tells Hermes to use the 10Mhz 1PPS provided by an attached GPSDO.
    * 1PPS "OK" will indicate that the system 'sees' the 1PPS signal, or not.
  * CWID Beacon
    * This allows us to run transmissions without having to remember to ID ourselves.  It will handle that for us in a user configurable manner.
  * Chirp Sweep & Shape Allows us to control
    * Sweep Frequency Range (2.5Khz up to 100Khz)
    * Sweep Hz Start and Stop (this is the audio ramp)
  * Override Defaults
    * Will allow the user to control timing of events in the Chirp.
    * By default we intend to attempt to determine the timing of the T/R relay in a users system (when monostatic mode is being used) however if the user knows the exact **safe** timings they can alter them here by overriding the defaults.

## Status ##


## Settings ##
  * monostatic mode (tx/rx) / bistatic mode (tx _or_ rx Only)
  * varying the audio frequency ramp
  * varying the bandwidth of the chirp from 3Khz up to 100Khz
  * varying the timing of the chirp from 1ms to 30ms
  * varying the timing of the TR relay (if known or desired timing, will be overridden by J3 status)
  * varying the timing of the RX period from 1ms tp 300ms
  * checking the condition of a user defined J16 pin for TX-INHIBIT (both J3 status voltages from the TR)
    * this may require FPGA code changes, or may just be something we need to check the status of if it already exists in the current FPGA code (it may just be a status check)
  * Ability to test (at low output power) the status of J3's so that we can determine the fastest TR speeds achievable)

## Abilities ##
  * Support for LSB, USB, CW
  * Effective Noise Blankers  (two levels NB, NB2, variable) optimized to allow Chirps
  * Effective Noise Reduction optimized to allow Chirps
  * Large Status "Lamp/Button" (Gray when OFF, Green in RX mode, Red in TX mode)
    * Clicking this button will stop all activity (used as a panic button, in case something goes wrong)
  * Display Modes
    * FFTW water fall Mode
    * Panadapter Display Mode
    * Panafall Display Mode
  * Other abilities
    * ability to CWID
    * ability to beacon
    * ability to determine exact lat/long via GPSDO device
    * ability to display results in km and miles
    * ability to display green-heron Azimuth and status
    * ability to relay data gathered back to a central web-service

## Web Service ##

  * api to accept relayed data from clients
  * ability to display results gathered on real-time web page for all to see
  * api should require as input from the client (for each data set sent) as a minimum:
    * callsign
    * lat/long
    * UTC timestamp (of the data report being made by the client)
    * 'echo report' data from the client software
  * Mapping
    * Echo data (showing hot-spots 'backscatter zones)
    * Locations of all stations (CDAR Chirp Transmitter(s), Echo Reception Stations)
      * callsign
      * lat/long and Maidenhead Grid
      * last report received UTC timestamp
