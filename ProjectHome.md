## CDAR = "Chirp Radar" ##
This project is intended to provide details on how "Chirp Radar" can be used to explore RF propagation at 50 Mhz using monostatic Chirp mode.  Although these same techniques can be used in bistatic as well.  Hopefully work that's been centered around bistatic mode already can be pulled in and reused in this project (TBD).

# Phases #

## Software spec ##
  * Still in-review. (this may take a while)
  * a lot of work has already been done by some very talented folks.  However, most of this work appears to be centered around bistatic mode, and we're working on monostatic mode.

## Information Gathering ##
  * Mostly completed

## Software spec ##
  * [Wish-List Here](https://code.google.com/p/cdar/wiki/Software)

## Hardware spec ##
  * Mostly completed

## Hardware Purchase ##
  * In process as of 2013-02-22
  * This process expected to take 30-60 days depending on funding available.
  * As of April 1, 2013 all but the final Rack Cabinet, 900w PA purchased and built.
  * As of April 9, 2013 I have ordered the final Rack Cabinet, and GPSDO & Antenna, all that remains is the 900w PA.

## Current Items of interest are ##
  * determine, and spec all required items. - Mostly Completed
  * a basic block layout for all required items - Completed
  * Getting from .350mw at 50Mhz to 1Kw TX in nano-seconds, and back to RX in under 1-3ms (without burning anything up) - Completed
  * Provide Sources for every component used in this project
    * Current Pricing - In Process
    * Part-Numbers - In Process
